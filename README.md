[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hofnerb/mboost.svg?branch=travis-ci)](https://travis-ci.org/hofnerb/mboost)

`mboost` implements boosting algorithms for fitting generalized linear, additive and interaction models 
to potentially high-dimensional data. 

This [github repositiry](https://github.com/hofnerb/mboost) is essentially just
a copy of the r-forge repository which is hosted at
[R-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/mboost).

## Installation

- Current version (from CRAN): 
  ```
  install.packages("mboost")
  ```

- Latest **patch version** (under development) from GitHub:
  ```
  library("devtools")
  install_github("hofnerb/mboost/pkg/mboostPatch")
  library("mboost")
  ```

- Latest **development version** from GitHub:
  ```
  library("devtools")
  install_github("hofnerb/mboost/pkg/mboostDevel")
  library("mboostDevel")
  ```

  To be able to use the `install_github()` command, one needs to install `devtools` first:
  ```
  install.packages("devtools")
  ```

- Alternatively, both the current patch and development versions of `mboost` (or `mboostDevel` respectively) 
  can be downloaded from R-forge if the built was successfull:
  ```
  install.packages("mboost", repos = "http://r-forge.r-project.org")
  ## or
  install.packages("mboostDevel", repos = "http://r-forge.r-project.org")
  ```
  However, currently these builts often don't succeed and furthemore are only available 
  for recent versions of R.
