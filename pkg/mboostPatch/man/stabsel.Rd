    Stability Selection
}
\description{
    Selection of influential variables or model components with error control.
}
\usage{
stabsel(object, cutoff, q, PFER,
        folds = cv(model.weights(object), type = "subsampling", B = 100),
        papply = mclapply, verbose = TRUE, FWER, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{an \code{mboost} object.}
  \item{cutoff}{cutoff between 0.5 and 1. Preferably a value between 0.6
    and 0.9 should be used.}
  \item{q}{number of (unique) selected base-learners per boosting run.}
  \item{PFER}{upper bound for the per-family error rate. This
    specifies the amount of falsely selected base-learners, which is
    tolerated. See details.}
  \item{folds}{ a weight matrix with number of rows equal to the number
                of observations, see \code{\link{cvrisk}}.}
  \item{papply}{ (parallel) apply function, defaults to  \code{\link[parallel]{mclapply}}.
    Alternatively, \code{parLapply} can be used. In the
    latter case, usually more setup is needed (see example for some
    details).}
  \item{verbose}{ logical (default: \code{TRUE}) that determines wether
    \code{warnings} should be issued. }
  \item{FWER}{ deprecated. Only for compatibility with older versions,
    use PFER instead.}
  \item{\dots}{additional arguments to \code{\link{cvrisk}}.}
}
\details{

  This function implements the "stability selection" procedure
  by Meinshausen and Buehlmann (2010).

  Two of the three arguments \code{cutoff}, \code{q} and \code{PFER}
  \emph{must} be specified. The expected number of false positives E(V), where
  V is the number of false positives, is controlled by \code{PFER}.

  As controlling the PFER is more conservative as controlling the
  family-wise error rate (FWER), the procedure also controlls the FWER,
  i.e., the probability of selecting at least one non-influential
  variable (or model component) is less than \code{PFER}.

}
\value{
  An object of class \code{stabsel} with elements
  \item{phat }{selection probabilities.}
  \item{selected }{elements with maximal selection probability greater \code{cutoff}.}
  \item{max }{maximum of selection probabilities.}
  \item{cutoff }{cutoff used.}
  \item{q }{average number of selected variables used.}
  \item{PFER }{per-family error rate.}

  A special print method for objects of class exists.
