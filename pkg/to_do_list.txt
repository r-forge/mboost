    o  richer Family objects are nedded (e.g., prediction and extraction of
       coefs needs to be handled with care if familiy=Binomial())

    o  predict.glmboost via coef.glmboost. Remove special code in bolscw

    o  do we need Matrix on attach?

    o  add missing files to svn (in inst)

    o  checks for QuantReg

    o  check status == "N" in wpbc

    o  na.action defaults checken

    o  use better colours

    o  fire a warning when AIC is called in cases the hat matrix is
       meaningless

    o  use col = rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.1) for lines in plot.cvrisk

    o  AIC(..., "classical") as default???

    o  multivariate responses

    o  reweight generic?

    o  hatvalues + AIC geht so nur fuer GaussReg!
    o  hat matrices fuer GAMS (Hastie & Tib)

    o  weighted median for offset in Huber / Laplace, see Hmisc:::wtd.quantile

    o  AIC(..., "corrected") monoton steigend???

    o  need party?

    o  look at coffee dataset
       http://sensor.ing.unibs.it/_people/pardo/dataset.html

    o  checks for gMLD
